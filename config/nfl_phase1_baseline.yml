# NFL Phase 1 Baseline Configuration Snapshot
#
# This is the frozen configuration used for the Phase 1 baseline.
# Any changes to model hyperparameters should be reviewed and approved.
#
# To verify the pipeline is using this config:
#   - Tests should confirm config values match expectations
#   - Changes should be reflected in PR descriptions
