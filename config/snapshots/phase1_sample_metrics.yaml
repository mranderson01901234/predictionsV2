# Phase 1 Sample Metrics Snapshot
#
# These are the expected metrics when running the sample pipeline.
# Used for regression testing to ensure pipeline changes don't degrade performance.
#
# Last updated: 2024-01-01 (initial baseline)
#
# Tolerance windows:
#   - accuracy: +/- 0.10 (sample data is small, so more variance expected)
#   - brier_score: +/- 0.10
#   - log_loss: +/- 0.15

# Expected values for sample pipeline
sample_baseline:
  # Note: These values are initialized to reasonable ranges for sample data
  # They will be updated after the first successful pipeline run
  accuracy:
    expected: 0.50
    tolerance: 0.20  # Wide tolerance for small sample
    min: 0.30
    max: 0.70
  brier_score:
    expected: 0.25
    tolerance: 0.10
    min: 0.10
    max: 0.35
  log_loss:
    expected: 0.70
    tolerance: 0.15
    min: 0.40
    max: 1.00

# Sanity check ranges (these should NEVER be violated)
sanity_checks:
  accuracy:

  brier_score:
    min: 0.0
    max: 1.0
  log_loss:
    min: 0.0
    max: 10.0  # Should never exceed this
  n_train:
    min: 10  # Sample should have at least this many training games
  n_test:
    min: 4   # Sample should have at least this many test games
